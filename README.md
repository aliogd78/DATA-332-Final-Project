# DATA 332 Final Project
 Ladybug and Butterfly Projects

We analyzed data on butterflies and ladybugs documented by Augustana College. We used RStudio to clean and visualize the data of the ladybugs and butterflies to see the distribution of the insects over decades, countries, and institutions. We also performed statistical tests to find averages of different values. We have added the charts we created along with descriptions as to why these charts are helpful in the overall analysis of the data. 

# LADYBUG PROJECT
The first step we did in cleaning the data was by making values in the stateProvince consistent. For example, if the value was "IL", we changed it to be "Illinois." We did the same step for other values as well. This was because we wanted the names of the states to be clear in our visuals. 

Next, we created a new column called "decade" to condense the years into their respective decade so that we could narrow our analysis to only the more recent decades of 2000-2020.
